Test client usage:

    usage: python test_client.py [-h] [-w W] [-l L] url

    positional arguments:
      url         URL of the nginx web server to send requests to

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -n N        Number of random user agent strings to send (default=10)
      -w W        Seconds to wait between requests (default=0.25)
      -l L        Length of garbage user agent strings (default=50)
      

    Note that this is mainly for testing that the User-Agent strings are
    being properly encoded so before running this you'll need to configure
    nginx to make use of the "access_updlog" command and add the new 
    variable $udplog_escaped-user_agent in your "log_format".

    Once configured, the access logs will then be written to the defined
    host via UDP. To see these you can listen on the port with socat and
    write the data to stdout:

        socat UDP-LISTEN:<port> STDOUT
